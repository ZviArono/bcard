 by Zvi Aronowitz

Welcome to my Business Card App - BCARD

Here you can find a variety of business cards that business have listed on my site
You can find full details of the business by clicking on the card.


You can register with your own account as a "Regular" user, which will only allow you to add listed cards to your favorite list, by clicking on the "like" icon - and viewing them all on the "FAV CARDS" page.


If you would like to add yours on business cards, you must register as a "Business" user account by marking the "sign up as business" checkbox.


With a business account you can view all your cards on the "MY CARDS" page and you can edit/delete your business cards that you created by clicking on the relative icon.


With an Admin user, you have full access to the App, you can Add/Edit/Delete your oun cards + Delete all cards, you with have access to "SANDBOX" page & "CRM" page that will allow you to Edit/Delete other users (that are not Admin users)
